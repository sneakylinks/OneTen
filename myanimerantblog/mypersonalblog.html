            <h4>Is Season 2 worth it?</h4>
            <p>My consensus a third of the way through this new seaons is that it's boring as hell. There's not really an overarching theme to the season at all, they didn’t do a good job writing any of the new characters, I don’t care at all about Einar. 
              <br>
              The writing as a whole is very shallow so far. They try to approach complex topics like slavery, the side effects of war, the human condition, etc but do it so poorly that I just end up caring very little about what they’re trying to say.
              <br>
              Each episode has the potential to be interesting, but the stakes are so low that I don’t feel like the show is actually engaging the topic fully. They introduced an entirely new setting and cast of characters so poorly that each episode I keep anticipating that they show will do a 180 and actually get good because if these characters mattered then why don’t I care about them at all?</p>

            <h4>Overrated or not?</h4>
            <p>There was so much hype surrounding the release of Chainsaw Man. And I just don't see why. I heard so many people saying that this was going to be a better version of JJK. But I don't get it. Maybe the show gets a lot better in future arcs, but so far JJk had a better story, better characters, and even a better power system. I also find the humor in Chainsaw Man to extremely cringe, and a lot of the social interactions in the show just seem disconnected.
            <br>So can people please tell me where the hype is coming from? Does it get a lot better in future arcs? I'm genuinely curious because I seem to be the only one with this take.</p>

            <h4>S-tier anime in the making</h4>
            <p>“Iruma-kun” is another example of an anime with a MAL score that isn’t indicative of how fucking good it really is.
              <br>
              The animation is stellar, the story is fun and engaging, and it manages to make every character likable from the MCs to the villains to even the side characters. Not to mention, they absolutely nailed it with the dub and the humor is actually pretty funny.
              <br>
              It just goes to show you that an anime doesn’t have to take itself too seriously to be good. I mean, it’s all about having fun and being entertained. And “Iruma-kun” is a show that you can watch with friends and family and just have a blast.
              <br>
              From what I’ve read, “Iruma-kun” is super popular in Japan but I doubt it’ll ever ascend to that level here in the west. Still, I consider it an S-tier anime that’ll continue to attract fans for many years to come.
              <br>
              What do you think? Do you really like “Iruma-kun” or nah? And would you consider it an S-tier anime?</p>
