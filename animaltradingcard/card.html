			<p>Capybaras are the largest rodents in the world! 
			Standing 2 feet (60 centimeters) tall at the shoulder and built somewhat like a barrel with legs, the “capy” has long, light brown, shaggy hair, a face that looks like a beaver’s, no tail, and slightly webbed feet. 
			Originally thought to be a pig of some sort, we now know that the capybara is a rodent, closely related to cavies and guinea pigs.</p>
